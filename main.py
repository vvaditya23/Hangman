#Step 1 
import random

word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
guess = input("Guess the letter: ").lower()

#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.
for alphabet in chosen_word:
  if alphabet == guess:
    print("Right!")
  else:
    print("Wrong!")

#step 2

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
